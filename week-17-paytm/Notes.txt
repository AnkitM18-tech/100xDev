Building any project =>

Points =>

1.Where to start - Feature planning
2.Design UI/UX

    - Frontend stack
    - Modules you’ll have (common/ui/backend)
    - Cloud to deploy to
4.LLD
    - Schema
    - Route signatures
    - Frontend Components - debatable
5.ER Diagrams - 
    - We can build these today, but usually not needed unless you’re a very visual person
6.How to think about features
    - Usually come from product
    - If you’re a founder, then just whatever u think is right
7.How much complexity is needed
    - Depends on the size of the company. For a startup, whatever helps you move fast w/o tech debt. For a company there are a lot of layers of review to go through
